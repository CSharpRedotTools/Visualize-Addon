# Now maintained in [ValksGodotTools/Template](https://github.com/ValksGodotTools/Template)
I tried out the Godot AssetLib by making this an addon but I no longer want to maintain it as a addon because
- Addons do not support GitHub submodules
- The process of updating the addon on the AssetLib website every new commit / PR is not automated
- Godot displays an annoying warning message if this Visualize project is included as a submodule in Template
